# Vocab Bot

This is a Telegram bot designed to help users look up word definitions in English, save them, and manage a personal vocabulary list. It connects to a PostgreSQL database and fetches word definitions from thefreedictionary.com

## Usage
•	Start the Bot: Send /start to the bot to initialize.
•	Look Up Definitions: Send any word, and the bot will return its definition. (Or it could also return something weird like a random abbreviation.)
•	Save Words: Click the “Add Word” button under a definition to save it.
•	View Saved Words: Use /mywords to see your saved vocabulary list.
